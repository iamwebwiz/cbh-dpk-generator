The `index.js` file contains the legacy code given for the assessment, and the `index.test.js` file contains the test suite for the legacy code. The files: `dpk-generator.js` and `dpk-generator.test.js` contain the refactored code and the test suite for that, respectively. The refactored code shows better organization of the code function into smaller functions doing specific things (Single responsibility). These smaller functions are reusable and makes it more readable hence providing better developer experience (DX).
